# Deloitte Hacky Holidays 2022 - Unlock The City

## Mission
Help! The smart city is in trouble. An A.I. algorithm went rogue in the once so peaceful intelligent city. It's chaos out there:  
  
To regain control and restore peace, we need a group of talented hackers to solve tricky challenges.  
  
Can we count on you to unlock the city?
